Hi there ðŸ‘‹ . Just a little about me: I am Ritvik, a Software Developer
based off the East Coast. I like working on cool and interesting projects,
and enjoy building automations and tools with Python and Rust, among
others.

Currently, I am pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at GMU. I also have
an interest in learning front-end web technologies, especially prevalent JS
frameworks such as React.

Rather than dive into anything else **really** about me, Iâ€™ll just refer you to my other online presences:

_Note:_ I'm kind of old school, even despite being a rather young guy. I'm planning on signing up for social sites like [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/), but I've left that on the back-burner for now, as I've other things to contend with, that tend to eat up too much of my time in general. But I promise, I'll get around to signing up for them eventually.

Also, I should probably pin my reading list here, while I'm at it. I rarely get any time to read anymore, but that's one of my
enduring passions and interests, ever since I was a young lad still in my prepubescent years.
