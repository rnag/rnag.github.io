Hi there ðŸ‘‹ â€” I'm Ritvik, a software developer based on the East Coast.

I enjoy building tools and automations that make life a little easier, often with Python or Rust in hand. Lately, Iâ€™ve been exploring modern frontend technologies â€” yes, even React has grown on me.

When Iâ€™m not in front of a screen, youâ€™ll likely find me running, hiking, or somewhere off the grid outdoors. I like to keep things balanced.

One of my better-known open source side projects is [Dataclass Wizard](https://github.com/rnag/dataclass-wizard) â€” a lightweight library for working with Python `dataclasses`.

If you're curious to learn more (or just want to say hi), feel free to explore the rest of the site or check out a few of my other haunts:

I tend to avoid most social media â€” not out of principle, but because there's usually something more interesting (or offline) calling for my attention.

Books, for instance. But weâ€™ll talk about that another time.
