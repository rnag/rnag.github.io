Hooray 🎉 — it’s finally live!

After far too many false starts and “I’ll get to it next week” moments, I’ve published my first personal site. It’s a humble beginning — more digital garden than polished showcase — but one I’m happy to tend to, slowly and intentionally.

This corner of the web exists for a mix of reasons: to host thoughts and tips I don’t want lost to time, to point toward things I’ve built or maintained, and maybe to capture a bit of who I am along the way — without giving away the whole story.

There’s a blog, of course, and perhaps a project or two worth exploring. One day it may take the shape of a more traditional portfolio. Or not. I’m still figuring that out, and I don’t mind the ambiguity.

So if you’ve somehow landed here — whether by curiosity, accident, or the whims of a search engine — welcome. Take a look around. Or don’t. This place will still be here, quietly growing, whenever you decide to return.

And as they’re [fond of saying]:
