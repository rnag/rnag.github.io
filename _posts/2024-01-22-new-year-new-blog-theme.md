  One snowed-in night, I gave my blog a full makeover. What started as boredom became a reset — and maybe, a quiet little revolution.

New year, new blog theme — and a snowstorm to stir things up. What began as a spontaneous idea turned into an all-night website overhaul, full of bugs, stubbornness, small wins, and too much tea. This isn’t a tutorial. It’s more of a ramble. But if you’ve ever faced a blank screen and felt stuck in your head, maybe you’ll find a kindred spirit here.

Keep reading if you’re curious how a minor blog refresh turned into a full-on winter escape plan — and what happens when you stop waiting for perfection and just... begin.

So — new year, new me.  
And hey, new blog theme too.

I finally ditched `minima`, the classic theme that everyone and their Jekyll-using cousin starts with. It’s solid. But I wanted something more... expressive. A site that felt like me. Or at least, a version of me.

Now I’m using `minimal-mistakes`. I’ve known about it for a while — kept meaning to try it, then kept not doing it. Classic. It wasn’t until a snowed-in Friday, a colleague calling it a “POW day” (prisoner of weather, not war), that I cracked and gave in. One part boredom, one part stubborn spark. I figured, why not?

It started with updating a config file. Then cloning the starter repo. Then spiraling into a full migration until 5:30AM. Somewhere between the third cup of tea and fixing my navigation bar, I realized I was having fun. Or something like it. Not quite joy — more like gritty satisfaction.

I won’t lie — there were bugs. Lots of them. Timestamps, tags, formatting. My posts felt like fragile paper houses and I was the wind. But piece by piece, things clicked into place. The new homepage looks like how I’d always imagined it: clean, personal, a little mysterious.

Now there’s a table of contents. Reading time estimates. A comment system. Even share buttons — including custom ones for WhatsApp and Email (which I had to hack in myself). I spent way too long tweaking those icons. But now they sparkle. They *work*. There’s pride in that.

Is it perfect? No. It’s not supposed to be. It’s meant to breathe. To give me space to write — even messily — without overthinking the frame it lives in.

This wasn’t a redesign. It was a reset. A little back massage for the blog, done entirely for me. Because sometimes, the most satisfying kind of progress is quiet and unseen — but you feel it all the same.

Thanks for reading. I’ve got a fitness benchmark tomorrow. Let’s hope I survive it.
