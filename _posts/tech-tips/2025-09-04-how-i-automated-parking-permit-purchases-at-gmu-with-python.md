{% include tech-tips-head-notice.html %}

As a grad student at **George Mason University (GMU)**, I commute to Fairfax once a week for evening classes. Like many commuters, I need parking ‚Äî but only for a few hours, usually **4‚Äì7 PM**.

Buying a semester-long permit didn‚Äôt make sense for my schedule (or wallet). Instead, the **daily parking permits** turned out to be cheaper and more flexible.

The problem? I always procrastinated. I‚Äôd remember to buy a permit at the last minute, sometimes right before class. It was stressful, repetitive, and just annoying.

So, being a CS student, I did what came naturally:

üëâ **I automated the entire process.**

## The Idea

Every week, I needed to:

1. Go to the GMU parking portal.
2. Log in with my credentials.
3. Navigate through a bunch of menus.
4. Select the right permit.
5. Enter payment details.

It was the same steps every time. Why not let Python handle it?

## The Tool

I built a small open-source tool in Python that:

* Automates login to the GMU parking portal up to the **Duo Mobile 2FA step** (which still requires approval on your phone).
* Selects the correct **daily parking permit**.
* Completes the checkout flow.
* Emails me a confirmation when done.

That‚Äôs it ‚Äî no more last-minute scrambling.

## Tech Breakdown

At its core, this project uses:

* **[Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)** ‚Äì to control a browser and interact with the GMU parking site.
* **Headless mode** ‚Äì so it runs quietly in the background.
* **Config + Environment variables** ‚Äì to keep credentials and payment info safe.
* **Task scheduling (optional)** ‚Äì you *could* use `cron` (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to kick off the script automatically. I usually just run it manually before class.
* **Duo Mobile 2FA** ‚Äì you‚Äôll still need to approve the login from your phone. The script pauses at this step until Duo is confirmed.

Here‚Äôs a simplified example of what the login step looks like in Python with Selenium:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys

# Start the browser (headless mode can be enabled too)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Go to GMU parking login page
driver.get("https://gmu.t2hosted.com/Account/Portal")

# Enter username
username_input = driver.find_element(By.ID, "username")
username_input.send_keys("myusername")

# Enter password
password_input = driver.find_element(By.ID, "password")
password_input.send_keys("mypassword")
password_input.send_keys(Keys.RETURN)

# (From here, the script navigates menus and purchases the permit)
```

The real project handles edge cases, payment, and confirmation, but this snippet shows the basic automation flow.

## Lessons Learned

A few interesting takeaways while building this:

* University systems often don‚Äôt have APIs, so **web automation** is sometimes the only option.
* **Security matters** ‚Äì never hardcode sensitive info; use config files or environment variables.
* Even small automations can save you from recurring stress (and are great coding practice).

## Try It Yourself

If you‚Äôre at GMU (or curious about automation), you can try it out:

üëâ [GitHub Project](https://github.com/rnag/GMU-Daily-Permit-Automation)

The `README` has setup instructions. Just remember: **use responsibly** ‚Äî the tool isn‚Äôt affiliated with GMU Parking Services, and you should only automate your own account.

## Final Thoughts

This project started as a way to save myself from procrastination, but it turned into a fun automation experiment. It‚Äôs one of those small quality-of-life improvements that adds up.

If you‚Äôre a fellow GMU commuter, hopefully this helps you too. And if you‚Äôre a developer, maybe it‚Äôll inspire you to automate some of your own daily annoyances.

While Duo Mobile means this isn‚Äôt 100% hands-free, it still saves me from repeating the same web clicks every week.
